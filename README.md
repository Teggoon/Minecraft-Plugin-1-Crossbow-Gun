# Minecraft-Plugin-1-Crossbow-Gun

A Minecraft Plugin made with the Spigot/Bukkit Library for Minecraft Java Edition 1.16.1.

First of my Minecraft plugins for fun: crossbows are basically guns.

Crossbow:

Right-click = semi-auto rifle mode. Fires high-speed, flaming arrows that one-shot creepers, zombies, and skeletons.

Left-click = shotgun. Fires four slow, spreading, flaming arrows each with less damage.

Ammo: needs none, but projectiles that don't hit entities disappear upon collision.
